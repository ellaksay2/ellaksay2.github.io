# for fun!

At UC San Diego, I was an active member of the Club Triathlon Team and Women's Surf Collective. I am passionate about human performance and increasing female representation in male-dominated sports. 

I also wrote and edited for the campus newspaper *The Guardian* and produced a weekly radio show called *Oh You Would Love It!*

I enjoy public libraries, curating playlists, baking banana bread, crocheting hats, and hanging out with my family.

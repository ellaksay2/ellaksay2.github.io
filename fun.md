Because I love data, you can follow my meticulously tracked hobbies on my [strava]( https://www.strava.com/athletes/78348760 ) (if you're outdoorsy) or [storygraph]( https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/ellaksay ) (if you're a bookworm). 

As a triathlete, cyclist and surfer, I am passionate about human performance and increasing female representation in male-dominated sports. 

While at UCSD, I also wrote and edited for the campus newspaper *The Guardian* and produced a weekly radio show called *Oh You Would Love It!*

I enjoy public libraries, curating playlists, baking banana bread, and crocheting hats.

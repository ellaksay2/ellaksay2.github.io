At UC San Diego I was an active member of the Club Triathlon Team and Women's Surf Collective. I also wrote and edited for the campus newspaper *The Guardian* and produced a weekly radio show called *Oh You Would Love It!*

A California girl, born-and-raised, I can often be found surfing, trail running, riding my bike or making banana bread.

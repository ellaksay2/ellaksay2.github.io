# for fun!

At UC San Diego, I was an active member of the Club Triathlon Team and Women's Surf Collective. I also wrote and edited for the campus newspaper *The Guardian* and produced a weekly radio show called *Oh You Would Love It!*

A California girl, born-and-raised, I can often be found surfing, trail running, or riding my bike. I enjoy public libraries, baking banana bread, crocheting hats, and hanging out with my family.

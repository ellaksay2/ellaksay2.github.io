At UC San Diego, I was an leader of the Club Triathlon Team and Women's Surf Collective. I am passionate about human performance and increasing female representation in male-dominated sports. 

I worked as a Brick Specialist for LEGO where my main responsibilities were to build display sets for the store. I also wrote and edited for the campus newspaper *The Guardian* and produced a weekly radio show called *Oh You Would Love It!*

I enjoy public libraries, curating playlists, baking banana bread, and crocheting hats.

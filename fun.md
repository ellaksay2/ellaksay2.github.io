At UC San Diego, I was on leadership for the Club Triathlon Team and Women's Surf Collective. I am passionate about human performance and increasing female representation in male-dominated sports. 

I also wrote and edited for the campus newspaper *The Guardian* and produced a weekly radio show called *Oh You Would Love It!*

I enjoy public libraries, curating playlists, baking banana bread, and crocheting hats.

Because I love data, you can follow my meticulously tracked hobbies on my [strava] (https://www.strava.com/athletes/78348760) (if you're outdoorsy) or [storygraph] (https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/ellaksay) (if you're a bookworm).

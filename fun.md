As a triathlete, cyclist and surfer, I am passionate about human performance and increasing female representation in male-dominated sports. Check out my [strava]( https://www.strava.com/athletes/78348760 ) to see how I spend most of my free time.

I enjoy public libraries (my [storygraph]( https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/ellaksay ) if you are  a fellow bookworm), curating playlists, baking banana bread, and crocheting hats.

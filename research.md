I am interested in studying how population dynamics lead to naturalistic behavior. 

Specifically, I am curious about spatial representations of conspecifics in the hippocampus and how these representations can be decoded for features of identity. 

I have extensive experience working with 2-photon calcium imaging data, pose-estimate machine learning models, and behavioral classification of hidden states. Additionally, I am advanced in several wet-lab techniques including histology, freely moving calcium imaging, optogenetics, fiber photometry and chemogenetics. 

More details on my past work can be found on my CV.

# research

I am broadly interested in studying how neuronal populations flexibly encode memories, particularly in spatial and social contexts. I am curious about studying this on a synaptic, network, and brain-wide scale using computational and systems techniques. 

More details on my past work can be found on my CV or my [Google Scholar]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ILHTQhkAAAAJ&hl=en](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ILHTQhkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)).
